# phpug-silex-intro
Intro to using Silex

Mini-talk for the Atlanta PHP user group to introduce Silex for building API's. The slides are also included 
in this repo. To run the sample application clone, run composer install, and make sure to add you db credentials 
in the config/global.php file.

Feel free to ask me any question and enoy!
